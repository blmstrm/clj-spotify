# clj-spotify
clj-spotify is a client library for accessing the Spotify Web API. clj-spotify aims to be identical to Spotify's Web API when it comes to naming of endpoints, path elements and query parameters therefore the documentation found here is very short. Please read through the [Spotify API Endpoint Reference](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/endpoint-reference/), a one to one mapping from the endpoints to functions in this library should be possible.

## Usage
Each function takes a map `m` of parameters and a sometimes optional oauth token `t`. Function names are the same as the names found in [Spotify's API Endpoint Reference](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/endpoint-reference/). A function call to retrieve a track from Spotify then has the function signature `(get-a-track m t)` and a function call to get an album's tracks has the function signature `(get-an-albums-tracks m t)` and so on.

### map `m`
The map `m` holds both path elements and query parameters.
Key names and value types in `m` are the same as those found in [Spotify's API Endpoint Reference](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/endpoint-reference/) for path elements and query parameters. Integer values such as `:limit` and `:offset` can be specified either as integers or strings in `m`. 

### oauth token `t`
For a simple method to obtain an access token through the Client Credentials flow, use `clj-spotify.util/get-access-token`. If you need oauth2 authentication through the Authorization Code Flow (for example, to use endpoints which access private user information), see this blog post on how to roll your own: [OAuth2 is easy - illustrated in 50 lines of Clojure](http://leonid.shevtsov.me/en/oauth2-is-easy).

### Return values
clj-spotify returns the data received from the Spotify Web API unaltered but the response will be converted from json to a Clojure map.

### Error handling
Error messages received from Spotify are returned unaltered as received from the servers. If an API call would result in an exception in clj-spotify this will be returned on the same format as Spotify's error messages but with the `:status` key set to `Exception`and the result of calling `(.getMessage e)` on the Exception `e` associated with the `:message` key.

## Development
### Registering a Client
Head to the [developer dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and register a new application.
If you wish to make use of the [`dev-resources`](./dev-resources/user.clj) in this project:
- Navigate to [your new app](https://developers.spotify.com/dashboard/applications), then > _edit settings_
- Setup two redirects: `http://localhost:3000/interact`, `http://localhost:3000/oauth2`
  * NOTE: The port/endpoint is arbitrary; just make sure your jetty server + handler, and redirects are pointing to the same URIs
- Take note of `CLIENTID, CLIENTSECRET`
- If you want to grab your user's URI while you're there, the [`/v1/me`](https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-current-user/) console is by far the most straightforward way.
  * Find the "uri" property in the payload, e.g. `"uri": "spotify:user:1134745600"`

### Hello Spotify (oauth2)
With credentials in hand, we're ready to make our first request!
- Ensure you've exported ClientId / ClientSecret as `SPOTIFY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID` & `SPOTIFY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET` respectively.
  * e.g, in a POSIX shell `EXPORT SPOTIFY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID='7bf224e8jn954215s3g11degh599e3an'`
- Open [`dev-resources/user.clj`](./dev-resources/user.clj), and a REPL
- Eval the buffer to load the forms, then call `(run)` to start the server
- Open http://localhost:3000/interact, go through the oauth flow
- Eval the following `(sptfy/get-current-users-profile {} (lm/oauth-token :spotify))`

## Additional documentation
Each function has a basic doc string but if the usage still is unclear please consult [Spotify's API Endpoint Reference](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/endpoint-reference/).
